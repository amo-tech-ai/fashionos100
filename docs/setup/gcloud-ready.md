# ✅ Google Cloud MCP Setup - READY!

## Setup Complete

All components are now configured and ready to use:

✅ **gcloud CLI**: Installed (v548.0.0)  
✅ **gsutil**: Installed (v5.35)  
✅ **Authentication**: Signed in as `ai@amoai.co`

## Next Step: Restart Cursor

**Restart Cursor** to load the MCP configuration. After restart:

1. MCP servers will auto-connect
2. You can use MCP tools to interact with Google Cloud
3. I can help you manage GCP resources via natural language

## What You Can Do Now

Once Cursor restarts and MCP connects, you can ask me to:

### Project Management
- "List all my GCP projects"
- "Show details for project gen-lang-client-0132512133"
- "Switch to a different project"

### Resource Management
- "List Cloud Storage buckets"
- "Check API quotas and usage"
- "Show enabled APIs for my project"
- "List Compute Engine instances"

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting
- "Check my GCP billing usage"
- "Show recent errors in Cloud Logging"
- "List active service accounts"
- "Check IAM permissions"

### Configuration
- "Enable the Gemini API"
- "Create a Cloud Storage bucket"
- "Set up a service account"
- "Configure default region/zone"

## MCP Servers Available

- **gcloud**: Execute gcloud commands via natural language
- **observability**: Query logs, metrics, traces
- **storage**: Manage GCS buckets and objects

## Your Current Setup

- **Account**: ai@amoai.co
- **Active Project**: gen-lang-client-0132512133 (fashionos)
- **Projects Available**: 5 projects

## Test After Restart

After restarting Cursor, try asking:

The MCP server will handle these requests automatically!
