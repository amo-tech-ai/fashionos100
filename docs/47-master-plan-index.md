## 🛠️ How to Use These Prompts

1.  **Sequential Execution:** Start with Phase 1 and move linearly. Dependencies are established in earlier phases.
2.  **Copy & Paste:** Each stage contains a specific "Prompt" block designed to be pasted into an AI coding assistant (like Google AI Studio, Cursor, or Windsurf).
3.  **Verification:** Each phase includes success criteria to verify before moving to the next.
