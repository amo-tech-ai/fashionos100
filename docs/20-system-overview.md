# FashionOS System Overview

## 1. System Overview
FashionOS is the first AI-native operating system designed to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of high-stakes fashion production. It replaces fragmented workflows (spreadsheets, emails, disparate tools) with a unified, intelligent platform powered by **Google Gemini 3 Pro**.

It moves beyond simple project management by acting as an **intelligent agent**:
*   It **reasons** about schedule conflicts.
*   It **sees** visual styles through multimodal inputs.
*   It **grounds** logistics in real-world data via Google Maps and Search.

## 2. The Fashion Show Lifecycle
FashionOS manages the five critical stages of production:

1.  **Concept & Vision:** Moodboarding, theme definition, and brand DNA analysis.
2.  **Planning & Sourcing:** Venue scouting (Maps), Team assembly, Budgeting.
3.  **Production & Casting:** Model casting, Fittings, Vendor contracts, Run-of-Show construction.
4.  **Execution (The Show):** Live backstage management, Caller cues, Front-of-House check-in.
5.  **Post-Show & Analytics:** Sponsor ROI calculation, Press coverage analysis, Financial reconciliation.

## 3. Real-World Examples

*   **The NYFW Mainstay:** A high-volume agency managing 5 shows in 3 days. FashionOS detects model overlaps between shows and optimizes call times to prevent delays.
*   **The Emerging Designer:** A solo designer planning their debut. The **AI Event Wizard** acts as a virtual producer, generating a checklist, budget, and timeline from a single text description.
*   **The Brand Experience:** A luxury house doing a destination show. **Maps Grounding** verifies venue constraints and logistics for a pop-up in a remote location.
