* Fashion entities:
  `venues`, `sponsor_organizations`, `event_sponsors`,
  `organizer_teams`, `organizer_team_members`,
  `fashion_brands`, `designer_profiles`, `event_designers`,

* Availability / scheduling:
  `venue_availability`, `model_availability`, `designer_availability`,
  `event_schedule`, `event_rehearsals`, `call_times`, `backstage_items`
* Analytics: views like `event_overview_view`, `task_with_assignees_view`, etc. (optional but recommended)

## 5️⃣ How to Use This Practically

* Use the **component list** as your **React/Figma build plan**.
* Use the **screen → table mapping** when:

  * Writing Supabase queries in each hook (`useEventTimeline`, `useEventTasks`, etc).
  * Designing RLS policies (who can read/write what).
  * Designing Edge Functions (e.g. `get-event-planner-view` should join exactly these tables).
